# Windows-Form-Application_Basic_Shopping_Site
This application is a Windows form application created on the basis of the mobile shopping applications we use in daily life.

In this application, different categories and sub-categories suitable for these categories were created. Unit price and name information for each product are entered in these created subcategories. A textbox has been added for the user to enter the number of products.

The buttons that direct all the information of the selected product to the basket section are placed under each product. The user can also remove the selected product from the basket, clean the basket or save the basket.

User information is taken from a file with a txt extension.
